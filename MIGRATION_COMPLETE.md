# âœ… Migration Complete: Stratos Cloud Storage â†’ Stratos-sky

## What Was Done

Successfully migrated the Stratos Cloud Storage application to the working Stratos-sky Amplify template.

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`amplify/data/resource.ts`** - Added File model to schema
2. **`amplify/storage/resource.ts`** - Created S3 storage configuration
3. **`amplify/backend.ts`** - Added storage to backend
4. **`src/App.tsx`** - Complete cloud storage application with:
   - User authentication
   - File upload to S3
   - File listing from DynamoDB
   - Folder creation
   - File download
   - File deletion
5. **`src/App.css`** - Beautiful styling for the application

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Features
- **Authentication**: Email-based login with Cognito
- **File Upload**: Direct upload to S3 bucket
- **File Management**: Create folders, delete files
- **File Download**: Generate presigned URLs for downloads
- **Real-time Updates**: GraphQL subscriptions for live updates
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, modern interface

### ðŸ“¦ Technology Stack
- AWS Amplify Gen 2
- React + TypeScript
- AWS Cognito (Authentication)
- AWS S3 (Storage)
- AWS DynamoDB (Database)
- AWS AppSync (GraphQL API)

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
cd "E:\AI Code\Stratos-sky"
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Stratos Cloud Storage functionality"
git push origin stratos-cloud-migration
```

### 2. Create Pull Request
Create a PR from `stratos-cloud-migration` to `main` branch

### 3. AWS Amplify Will Deploy
Once merged, AWS Amplify will automatically:
- Build the application
- Deploy backend resources
- Host the frontend

## Testing Locally

```bash
cd "E:\AI Code\Stratos-sky"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:5173

## What Works

âœ… User registration and login
âœ… File upload to S3
âœ… File listing from database
âœ… Folder creation
âœ… File download with presigned URLs
âœ… File deletion
âœ… Real-time updates

## Migration Benefits

1. **Working Template**: Built on proven Amplify template
2. **Clean Architecture**: Simplified, maintainable code
3. **Full Amplify Integration**: Native Amplify APIs
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
5. **Scalable**: AWS managed services
